# Component Illustrations - LEDs

Illustrations that I find useful when designing enclosures or trying to do mock-ups to test component placement.

All of the illustrations I've shared in the Graphics folder are of my own creation. You're welcome to use them for personal-use, but commercial use is prohibited. Thanks for understanding!

## Affinity Designer Support

If you're using Affinity Designer, be sure to grab the file ending in .afdesign instead of the regular PDF. The Affinity Designer file is highly organized and will make quick work of adding these illustrations to your global assets, making them much faster and easier to use when doing mock-ups.

## Not using Affinity Designer?

No problem. Download the layered PDF file instead. Most other vector drawing programs should be able to use the layered PDF, it just may not be as organized as the Affinity Designer native file.
