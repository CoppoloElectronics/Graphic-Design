# Pedal Building Stuff

Just a few of the things that I find useful for guitar pedal building. Some of the items I've either created myself or have gathered from other generous folks that have made them available for use.

## Graphics-Related

Templates and illustrations that I find useful when designing enclosures or trying to do mock-ups before ordering prints.

All of the illustrations I've shared in the Graphics folder are of my own creation. You're welcome to use them for personal-use, but commercial use is prohibited. Thanks for understanding!
