# Graphics - Knobs

Templates and illustrations that I find useful when designing enclosures or trying to do mock-ups to test label placement and get a general feel for the look of the finished device when designing graphics for enclosures.

All of the illustrations I've shared in the Graphics folder are of my own creation. You're welcome to use them for personal-use, but commercial use is prohibited. Thanks for understanding!

## Affinity Designer Support

If you're using Affinity Designer, be sure to grab the file ending in .afdesign instead of the regular PDF. The Affinity Designer file is highly organized and will make quick work of adding these jacks to your global assets, making them much faster and easier to use when doing mock-ups.

## Want to Support My Efforts?

Folks that support creators are awesome! If you feel like I've provided you with something useful and you'd like to show your appreciation, feel free to give my repo a star. If giving me a star just doesn't feel like enough, you can contribute to my guitar pedal building hobby by supporting me through the "Sponsor this project" links at the main page of my repo!

Thank you so much and happy pedal building!
